I was REEALLY bad at taking notes this year.. It was my first year, and I hit a lot of talks but mostly did a LOT of exploring and hands-on stuff.

This was a good talk that I was glad I saw it in person

It was also the year that we had the bomb threat. so that was an experience. I got a challenge coin from someone just standing out there with us. 


Anyhow, I took a few photos with my flip phone. Here they are.

For the first time at DefCon?  Yeah, I'll miss my breakfast burrito, but next year will be good too. Fun times.
