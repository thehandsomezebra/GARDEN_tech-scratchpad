This talk, which I caught in the Cloud Village, was a deep dive into the kinds of Azure misconfigurations that are terrifyingly common in the wild. As a DevOps engineer, I'm constantly working with cloud identities, so seeing a breakdown of how easily nested groups and role-assignable groups can create unintended privilege escalation paths was very relevant. A key focus was on Conditional Access Policies, which are often the main line of defense but are frequently undermined by a web of complex exclusions. The session was a powerful example of how these seemingly small configuration details can create massive security holes.
