#### How We Accidentally Became Hardware Hackers

Common Ground, 14:00 Tuesday

[Kyle Shockley](https://bsideslv.org/speakers#CRFZTR),Â [Caleb Davis](https://bsideslv.org/speakers#NDNJCU)


As a creative person with a basement full of tech hobbies, this talk by Kyle Shockley and Caleb Davis was one I could immediately relate to. Their "buddy-film-esque" journey from making what they called "trash" hardware to becoming hardware hackers felt incredibly relatable. It's easy to look at a field like hardware hacking and feel overwhelmed, thinking you need specialized, expensive gear and some kind of secret knowledge. Kyle and Caleb completely dismantled that idea by sharing their own laughable mistakes and endless dependency hells. Their core message was that every broken circuit and embarrassing security decision was actually a valuable lesson in disguise, building the exact skills they'd need later for cybersecurity.

What I loved most was how they connected their electrical engineering background to the hands-on, practical skills of hacking. The experience gained from diagnosing incorrect component footprints or fixing a bad solder joint directly translates to the world of power analysis and fault injection. They reframed the idea of failure in a way that was relatable. Those frustrating moments when a project doesn't work aren't setbacks; they are the curriculum. This session was a fantastic reminder that the path into a complex field like hardware hacking is paved with trial, error, and the willingness to just dive in and learn from what you break.
