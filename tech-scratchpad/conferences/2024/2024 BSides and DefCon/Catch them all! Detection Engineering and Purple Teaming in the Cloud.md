The core idea was using open-source tools to simulate cloud attacks and then validate your detection rules...a proactive approach that I can appreciate. The introduction of the open-source project, [Grimoire](https://github.com/DataDog/grimoire), which provides pre-built datasets of attack logs, was another great takeaway for turning the attacker's playbook into a practical security roadmap.
