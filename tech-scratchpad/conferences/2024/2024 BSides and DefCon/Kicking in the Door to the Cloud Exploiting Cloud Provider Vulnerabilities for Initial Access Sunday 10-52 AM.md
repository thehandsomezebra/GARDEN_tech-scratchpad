Nick Frichette's talk shifted the focus from typical customer misconfigurations to vulnerabilities within AWS services themselves. He demonstrated how a confused deputy vulnerability in AWS AppSync could be used to hijack IAM roles in other accounts... a powerful reminder that the services we build on can become the attack surface. His research into how AWS Amplify unintentionally exposed customer IAM roles further drove home the point that we need to be aware of the security posture of the cloud provider's own tools, not just our own infrastructure.
