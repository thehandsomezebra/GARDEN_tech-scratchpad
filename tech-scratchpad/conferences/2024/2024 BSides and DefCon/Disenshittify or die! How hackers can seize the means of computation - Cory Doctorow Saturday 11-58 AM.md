This follow-up talk from [[2023 Black Hat and DefCon|2023 DefCon]] on dis-enshitification laid out the playbook for how platforms decay... they start by being good to users, then lock them in, and pivot to serving business customers before extracting all the value for themselves. He argued this is only possible because the four forces that used to discipline tech like competition, regulation, interoperability, and worker power have been dismantled. I remember the early days of the internet... Cory's talk had a good call to action to restore sanity is a necessary path to keep our future well... *ours*.
