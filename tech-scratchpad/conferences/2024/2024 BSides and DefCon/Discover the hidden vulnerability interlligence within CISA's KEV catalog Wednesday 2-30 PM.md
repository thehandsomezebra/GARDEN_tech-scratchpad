#### Discover the Hidden Vulnerability Intelligence within CISAâ€™s KEV Catalog

Ground Floor, 14:30 Wednesday


[Glenn Thorpe](https://bsideslv.org/speakers#MXQFGW)

Glenn Thorpe's talk on the CISA KEV catalog was a great deep dive into a data source that many of us in security rely on. As someone who deals with vulnerability management, it's easy to treat the KEV as just a simple to-do list, but this session showed how to find real intelligence by looking at the metadata and trends. The most actionable parts were the hidden signals for prioritization, like the silently updated "known ransomware campaign use" flag, which is a critical piece of operational intelligence. The talk also pointed out how the required "time to fix" can indicate severity, with some vulnerabilities added on Fridays having a much shorter seven-day remediation window, giving teams the kind of non-obvious data points needed to make smarter, faster decisions.
