#### Tracking and hacking your career

Hire Ground, 13:30 Wednesday

[Leif Dreizler](https://bsideslv.org/speakers#GJN7BT), [Misha Yalavarthy](https://bsideslv.org/speakers#FQPWTM)

This session with Leif Dreizler and Misha Yalavarthy was a solid, practical guide on taking control of your own career path. As an engineer, it's easy to get buried in the day-to-day work and expect your manager to map out your growth, but this talk emphasized that the most effective approach is a collaborative one where you are in the driver's seat. They laid out a clear method for translating a company's career ladder into a personal Career Development Plan (CDP), which immediately struck me as a powerful tool for navigating promotions and performance reviews.

I ended up jumping out of this session early, but basically it reminded me of a brag document that I use at work. - [https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/ "null") 
By maintaining a plan and making your work visible through blog posts or internal wikis, the dreaded self-review process becomes much simpler because you've already gathered the evidence. They really summarized a good strategy that helps protect you from career setbacks when your team or manager changes, ensuring the person most invested in your career—you—is also the most prepared.
