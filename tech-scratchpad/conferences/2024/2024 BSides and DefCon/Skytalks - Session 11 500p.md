... Back to [[2024 BSides Vegas and DefCon]] ...



Skytalks. Last one I got to participate in. So, again, you know the drill - ya had to be there.... and I'm glad I was there. This session was another good one, and it confirmed my own experiences that I've had while conducting interviews in the past year. Folks would join the interview and lip-sync to someone else who "knew" the answers.. like, yep, this whole talk confirmed that I'm not crazy, that it does happen and it's a major issue... It's an organized problem of state-sponsored actors getting hired into tech. Having dealt with this first hand? not fun.
