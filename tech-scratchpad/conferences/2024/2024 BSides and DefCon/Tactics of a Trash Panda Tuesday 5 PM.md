#### Tactics of a Trash Panda

Ground Floor, 17:00 Tuesday
[Angel Gamboa](https://bsideslv.org/speakers#GJHYX8)

Angel Gamboa's "Tactics of a Trash Panda" was a fun session that perfectly captured the spirit of creative problem-solving. As someone who spends a lot of time 3D printing and tinkering with electronics, the idea of ditching expensive, specialized entry tools for DIY alternatives is very appealing. The talk championed a "raccoon" mentality, focusing on how to be resourceful by turning everyday items from craft stores or even the trash into effective physical penetration testing tools. It was a great look into the practical side of hacking, showing how items like bobby pins, windshield wipers, and even polymer clay can be used to craft lockpicks or cast duplicate keys.

The presentation went through a number of clever, low-budget techniques, from using cornstarch for forensic analysis to building network monitoring tools with an Orange Pi instead of a pricier Raspberry Pi. The session was packed with useful demonstrations that drove home the point that resourcefulness and a willingness to experiment are more valuable than a bag full of expensive gear. It was a solid encouragement for any tech hobbyist to see how far creativity and readily available materials can take you in the world of physical security.
