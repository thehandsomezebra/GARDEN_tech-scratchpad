... Back to [[2024 BSides Vegas and DefCon]] ...


It was an incredible opportunity to be in a room with other BSides organizers from all over the world. With representatives from major events like Las Vegas, San Francisco, and even the other side of the planet, the depth of experience was immediately apparent. Our main reason for being there was to get a crash course for reviving BSides Detroit. Being able to hear firsthand stories about what works, what doesn't, and the unique challenges different cities face was invaluable. The meetup provided a fantastic chance to absorb years of lessons learned and build connections with the people who are passionate about making these community-driven security conferences successful.
