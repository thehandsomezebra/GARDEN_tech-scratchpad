#### The road to developers’ hearts

Ground Floor, 14:00 Wednesday

[Sing Ambikapathi](https://bsideslv.org/speakers#LEWH38)


This talk from Sing Ambikapathi was a great look into the human side of DevSecOps, focusing on how to bridge the gap between security and development teams. Coming from the perspective of a developer who moved into security, their points on building trust felt very authentic. In my own work, I see how the relationship between teams can make or break a project, and this session reinforced the idea that being available and responsive is one of the most effective ways to build that trust. It’s a simple concept, but it's crucial for creating an environment where developers feel comfortable raising security concerns early.

The session also provided some solid, actionable advice for security practitioners. A key point was the need to provide specific, realistic recommendations and avoid the vague "it depends" answer that can stall progress. The talk also covered the importance of finding allies within development teams and mentoring those with an interest in security. This approach of embedding security champions within the culture (like what I do at work) is a far more sustainable way to improve an organization's posture than simply escalating issues or relying on top-down mandates.
