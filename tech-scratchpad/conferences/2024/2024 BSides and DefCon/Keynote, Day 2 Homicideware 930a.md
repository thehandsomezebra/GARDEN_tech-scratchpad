#### Keynote, Day 2: Homicideware

Breaking Ground, 09:30 Wednesday

[Andrea M. Matwyshyn](https://bsideslv.org/speakers#JWKWTZ)

Andrea Matwyshyn's keynote was a sobering look at the evolution of security policy over the last 25 years. She made a compelling argument for reframing our industry's mindset away from "cybersecurity" and towards a broader concept of "technology safety." For those like me- building and maintaining systems, this talk was perfect. The scope of our work has expanded, with our code now deeply embedded in critical infrastructure like hospitals and transportation, where an outage can have serious real-world consequences. The talk drew a direct line from the engineering catastrophes of the past to the security incidents of today, showing that the root causes are often the same.

The 1919 Boston Molasses Disaster was a particularly effective historical example. Matwyshyn detailed how the company knew the storage tank had structural issues—locals even saw it leaking—but chose to paint over the cracks to meet wartime production deadlines instead of performing proper repairs. This story is an uncomfortably familiar parallel to modern software development, where teams often hide technical debt to meet a release date. The talk used this to show how the legal landscape is now shifting to catch up with technology. It was a strong reminder that the choices we make as engineers, and the risks we accept to meet deadlines, carry more weight than ever and are being scrutinized through a much more serious legal and public safety lens.
