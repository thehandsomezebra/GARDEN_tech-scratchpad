#### Redis or Not: Argo CD & GitOps from an Attacker’s Perspective

Breaking Ground, 10:30 Tuesday

[Elad Pticha](https://bsideslv.org/speakers#UJGN8C), [Oreen Livni Shein](https://bsideslv.org/speakers#LKQCZ3)

This session by Elad Pticha and Oreen Livni Shein was a real eye-opener, especially for anyone working in the GitOps and Kubernetes space. As someone who lives and breathes containerization and automation, I rely on pipeline tools to keep things running smoothly, so a talk focused on its security from an attacker's perspective was right up my alley. They uncovered a critical 9.1 vulnerability that essentially turns Argo CD's Redis cache into a backdoor. It was fascinating to see how, by manipulating data in Redis, an attacker could bypass validation checks and deploy their own malicious pods to potentially gain full control over the cluster. It’s a stark reminder that even the tools we trust for continuous delivery can have attack vectors we haven't considered.

The biggest takeaway for me was the breakdown of the attack path and the practical steps for mitigation. Patching Argo CD to the latest version is the crucial first step. The talk also drove home the importance of applying core DevSecOps principles to the problem. They made a strong case for running Argo CD in a separate, isolated cluster and enforcing strict network policies to lock down access. The session was a powerful call to action to be more deliberate when architecting our GitOps environments, to always adhere to the principle of least privilege, and to question the implicit trust we place in every component of our stack.
