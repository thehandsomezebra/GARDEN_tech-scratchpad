This talk was a deep dive into Kubernetes security, focusing on how simple misconfigurations in YAML files and RBAC settings can lead to major vulnerabilities.

The most interesting part was their research into CNCF projects, where they found these exact issues, which really drives home the point that you can't implicitly trust default configurations, even from established projects.
