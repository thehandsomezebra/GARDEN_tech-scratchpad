#### Nothing Went to Plan….. Because You Didn’t Have a Plan

Ground Floor, 15:00 Wednesday

[0DDJ0BB](https://bsideslv.org/speakers#KXYSXL)

This talk by 0DDJ0BB was a much-needed, practical guide to incident response planning, a topic that’s critical for anyone in a DevOps or SRE role. The session cut through the usual complexity by framing the entire process with the simple "People, Process, Technology" model. This approach emphasized starting with people first—identifying your key contacts across the business in Legal, HR, and Finance before an incident strikes, not during the chaos. By establishing that human foundation, it becomes much more straightforward to define a clear process and apply the right technology, creating a simple, tested plan that is infinitely better than a perfect, unread one.
