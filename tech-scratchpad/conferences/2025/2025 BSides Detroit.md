So this was the first conference I ever talked at!

I gave a talk about vibe coding and securing the inputs n outputs. I'm a devops engineer, so I took the position (naturally) that at the end of the day - it's just code.. and we can support and secure it when it hits our pipelines.

I managed to record the audio of it, so watch it with the slides here!
