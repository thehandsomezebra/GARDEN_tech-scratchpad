This site is a digital garden, a pile of notes as my scratchpad for my thoughts on stuff n things.

It's not a blog. It's not chronological. Some things *have* been posted to a blog, but not all. 

You'll find a mix of content here, loosely organized into a few main folders. Pick a thing on the sidebar and explore. 

Also, checkout my other [gardens](https://garden.handsomezebra.com)

Thanks for stopping by!
