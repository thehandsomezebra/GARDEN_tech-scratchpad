# Digital Garden: Tech Scratchpad
This repository contains the source for my personal digital garden and knowledge base.

It's a collection of notes, thoughts, and resources on a variety of technical topics, including DevOps, software development, and security. You'll find everything from raw notes from conferences like DEFCON and BSides to more polished blog posts and how-to guides.

This space is built with Quartz and is designed to be an evolving, interconnected web of ideas rather than a traditional chronological blog.
