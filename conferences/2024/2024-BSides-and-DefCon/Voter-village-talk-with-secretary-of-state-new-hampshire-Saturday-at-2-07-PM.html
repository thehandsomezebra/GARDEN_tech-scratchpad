Vegas and DefCon</a> …</p>
<p>The talk centers around the importance of election security and voter confidence in the United States, specifically highlighting the speaker’s experiences as the Secretary of State in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>The speaker emphasizes the unique nature of New Hampshire’s election process, where local officials elected by their communities hold significant responsibility in administering elections. This decentralized system, while contributing to a strong sense of local control, also presents challenges in maintaining transparency and addressing voter concerns. The talk then focuses on two key areas of concern that emerged in recent elections: voter confusion surrounding ballot counting machines and absentee voting procedures.</p>
<p>Here are some key takeaways and big items from the talk:</p>
<ul>
<li>The importance of transparency in the election process, particularly around ballot counting and absentee voting.</li>
<li>The need for voter education to address misconceptions and build trust in the electoral system.</li>
<li>The increasing use of technology in elections and the importance of addressing vulnerabilities to maintain security and integrity.</li>
<li>The impact of misinformation and disinformation on voter confidence and the importance of combating these threats.</li>
<li>The need for respectful dialogue and collaboration between individuals with differing viewpoints to address challenges to election integrity.</li>
<li>The critical role of volunteers and local election officials in ensuring fair and accurate elections.</li>
<li>The potential for human error in the election process and the importance of checks and balances to mitigate risks.</li>
<li>The need for continued efforts to engage voters and promote participation in the democratic process.</li>
</ul>

<p>[Speaker 1]
Yeah.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
She was like, you know, yeah.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Hello. Hello! Everybody hear me. Hi, I’m</p>
<p>[Speaker 2]
So excited to introduce our next speaker. Uh, secretary Scanlon has served the state of New Hampshire as the Secretary of State since 2022, which he was elected elevated to Secretary of State due to the retirement of one of the country’s longest, serving secretaries and State Bill Gardner Secretary of Scandler, as Deputy secretary for As many duties has been to oversee and lead elections in New Hampshire, a secretary in a state that every four years is spotlighted holding the first in the nation presidential primary. He knows firsthand the importance of every election, his leadership and oversteem transparent. And secure elections is just one of his many accomplishments secretary, scamlanch continues to serve the lead, the nation, in Innovative ideas and program.</p>
<p>[Speaker 2]
Security. He recognizes the need for discussion in a respectful space. He appointed a voter confidence committee to meet in all corners of the state to understand the challenges and have the tough discussions. Realizing the importance of everyone’s voice, he appointed people with bats, differing opinions, those questioning the election process and those that trusted it this committee when a great distance and turning down the temperature of the discussion, understand And how they work with the focus on gaining, a more respectful debate. He also appointed the states. First adverse Civics education, voter coordinator, secretary, Scanlit, and graceless, technology and respects the power and responsibility. That attaches with it. He led the nation through one of our nation’s first 81 generated Robo, call replicating, President, Biden’s, voice and Beckham in an attempt to misle</p>
<p>[Speaker 2]
Me and give a very very warm welcome for the Secretary of State from New Hampshire, Dave Scandal.</p>
<p>[Speaker 3]
That’s great.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Thank you Catherine. It’s a real pleasure for being to be here today to speak to this group. This is the first Defcon that I’ve attended, and I can tell you, it’s pretty, it’s really pretty amazing. And I’m sure I just scratching surface when actually takes place here. I’m not going to assume that everybody knows what a secretary of State does. So let me just take a second to say that most secretaries of state are an agency had in state government. And we have many, although the ministerial duties, we do things like register business entities to not operate in the state, a corporation or</p>
<p>[Speaker 3]
LLC</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Partnerships, things like that. We have a records management division</p>
<p>[Speaker 3]
Which</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Also allows Uh, so</p>
<p>[Speaker 3]
We came to space most important programs. We have a division of Vital Records to keep track of</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
First fat, spirits and verses life events basically. And you can see where I’m located is kind of a one day, job keeping right at this point but then many Secretary of States also have responsibility of administrative relations. And then sure I may achieve the life officer</p>
<p>[Speaker 3]
Of the</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
State. So the lifestyles are my best when they were a big election related editions and almost The country has so</p>
<p>[Speaker 3]
Many responsibilities but not all social terms will stay administer election, some stays on the board of elections</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
And they may not have that responsibility. Some states, Trump secretaries of State, and National Border vehicle and registrations inside. Every action does not And each state, Alexis Secretary of State differently in New Hampshire on one of three secretaries around the country. They’re actually elected by the state of legislation. So after the general election is over the new members, take our seats, they usually elect their chamber officers and then they elect constitutional officers in New Hampshire as the Secretary of State and Penn State Treasurer many secretaries of state run at large and the general election Network. And they are</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Privacy basis. And, you know, they represent your party if they have their parties nomination on the general election ballot, Elected that way. And then there are some that are appointed by the government and then there are a couple of states where the lieutenant, you know automatically serves as the Secretary of the state. The way, the secretary’s administer elections and their individual states, that are also different Many states, especially when you get What’s the Mississippi River? Have major County election organizations and so on the Secretary of State and a general oversight over the process, there are actually County election administrators that are responsible thing for things like printing ballots deciding which voting machines or ballot accounting devices going to use that election and things like that in New Hampshire. We’re we are a small state of geographic</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
We have 1.4 million voters and that means that there are many cities in this country that are actually larger than the population of the state of the national. Watching the process goes back to Colonial times when there is a general mistrust government in some ways, it’s terrible to, we’re allow people are feeling today. 400 number of House of Representatives, in the state with that population 1.4 million If California had that same type of representation, they would have a legislature that is an assessment. I think it’s 15 000 legislators. And so, that’s because When our state constitution was created and that mistrust of government,</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Uh, was there. The forefathers at the time decided that they were going to spread the power government as broadly across the population as they could and they did a good job with it. It was still in effect today. And that’s the way we do business. Our election is the process is also very soon every town. And sitting here. Is a common place in New Hampshire and every polling place in New Hampshire is collects from its citizens. Its both of them, the moderator, a town, clerk three supervisors of a checklist And all of our election officers.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
They are elected by their neighbors families, people in the community that believe that they have the honesty and integrity and the capability to do a good job, running an electrical process. Could literally be impossible in my opinion to have any kind of broad conspiracy in our state related to on the election process. Every town, every, every polling place decides whether or not they are going to use. Electronic Valley County device in your jurisdiction, so that is a local decision. And New Hampshire is currently the process for placing the old Macy Road, OS devices that are on table in here. And the other one, with a couple of pure origin, digital stem devices, which have just been recently approved by the state law information. So that’s kind of the nature of how the election process.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
To go into this part by telling you the story about an event that happened during the 2020 general election in New Hampshire. And if you recall the 2020 election was the pandemic election. New Hampshire is a state where to vote my mail absentee, you have to have an experience. And the excuses, you don’t have to be absent or you have a disability.</p>
<p>[Speaker 3]
And</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Then the statutes kind of break those two categories down. For example, it is a more specific plan. Attorney, general, and Governor determined that, because of the pandemic, It was a major public health crisis. And that if voters in the state, I felt unsafe by going out of public mode that they could use that as a reason to go by accident the way as it was a form of disability, I suppose you had that medical tradition that you were concerned about And because of that, we had it three times the number of absentee ballots that were normally cast in an election. So after the election took place, we had a town on Massachusetts Florida and then they would win some of them. I have heard of it and the results were hosted and I and New Hampshire is the opinions process promoting. Also, Einstein voters show up to check in A</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
These girls with them, they put balance, you know, one before all the counter devices. Today is the poor place, but then the poles flows. We have the moderator against the results. Take off with those places ads, then in a hand count votes, And then they push the results to the point place. Before they post companies. So the voters know what the results were for, that public place and then that exact paperwork. So the Secretary of State following Mortgage that we can certify those results in Windham, there were four states or state representatives, and or elections. So I went to collectible uh for Southern Senator East and in that election for Republicans candidates want</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Uh, president that was 24 hours from and this is the town where they were probably over 5 000 volts across right under the largest. So she naturally requested Harry Academy that they had was ever failed and then kind of a large amount Hospital and the recount is hell. And in New Hampshire, the way we conducted recap is when we’re seeing Alex from town work, we also artists in public, we we</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Time. So that it happened or the representatives and see every single part on those ballots. And now those calls for pounding So, when a recount was over, Went for 24 months, 2 400. Yeah. And they say, absolutely no explanation, as to why they haven’t had a, you know, the process frame would smoothly and appealing like the same amber ballots. Also Orchest in the garage</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Yeah. And there was no explanation and still saying I don’t have Animals became to no conclusions. We didn’t speculate the blind end and spread to advice. But that’s the way it was but it’s only provision. You can at that point, I mean, and it’s a recount was appeal to the power organization which is we broke the appealand promises, but the bad luck. We should have no amount of information and we have to bring out to change the outcome of the repair. So</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
And in the legislature and especially because at that time we had no model opportunity. Broward County crisis and so the legislature in the January and they quickly passed the bill they call for a foreign of that particular election. And the statement, you know, an extra encounter like you can show us how our worst team to be the representative of the state. And then the town, I chose in Oregon, another little uh, computer scientist. And then the two of them do that together were an extension for the third, which was called to start. And so it would be three of them was together as the organized style of writing about it which Market tapewise.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
And they were ridiculous wanted to report, valid reviewing every member in time. Looking at the code, They digitally scan all the ballots. Years in the election. And when it was all done, after about three weeks, a lot of screaming. Um, it came down to human error. Is what they found out was. There was a priestron where the absentee that was followed him, that went through one of the Target robots. For that Democratic campus that has close race and where that place between the target level and the motor has not filled in and over both of that person. It was enough of a shelling if it’s falling on the Prius Adam was dating, right? Bye guys. As a book and so we counted the votes. Obviously we are not ratings.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
And I’ll explain the best friends, because It was that the town court was going down excited because of a huge number of absolutely habits. If they were dealing with that, that instead of hand, folding each ballot on the score line of answering the Press, that intentionally described her throughout the Target on Nissan. And she decided to use an uncalibrated bladder folder to follow your values. And when that was the reason why the line was going to retard, You can imagine a conspiracy theories that were taking place. Wildlife situation existing and in fact, they have not gone away and that’s the unfortunate thing about, you know, this process.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
And the mistakes that are potentially are coming back really cause problems in your future. In New Hampshire. And I think this is true in just about every state We rely on a lot of volunteers towards homes. I mentioned to you the first about 10 local officials that were elected to do each trial, but it is on a part-time basis and then they have, they had to find other individuals to put in on how to add classes especially in the larger times do that job and so the president process and because there’s still set up. Has to take place. This seems for me.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
And I passed away a lot of times bigger song. I don’t understand to be perfect. They were designed to accurately reflect his outcomes of our elections were. So now we have that human factor, founded off against technology and people believe the technology shouldn’t be growing. So we have these two systems that are now coming together and a trick that we have as a Def</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
The human finances and there are mistakes that are That this process is perfect and that’s the reason why the recounting appeals and things like that just to make sure that we get it right. So, These are really challenging times to be an election administrator as our politics. We’re so polar on this, and in that process, the election process, which was a sleeping thing that we did. Every company University, people trusted the results. And, and you know, there were emotions, ever since 2000 and Power, there has been a lot of screwdry and got your process. There’s a lot of information.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Of private systems were</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
And so we’re in a situation and the elections themselves are becoming Buddhistars, the parties have realized that, you know, making control of these. It’s been nothing in the elections. They might be able to raise indefinity, you know, if their person is where their team is, you know, in that position. So there’s all of the political climate is just challenging but yes.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
And I have built them changed together that as people that are registered in both local parties, and we treat every legislator and same night, and we just try and do the best job that we can at. Ministering the laws around the house. Happy Christmas time. The other thing as we were trying to do is get a dialogue line. The individuals that have these ideas care issues or the electrical process and, and the general loaders. I hope everybody understand how these processes work. So as Catherine mentioned, in my introduction, I put together what I call the special committee on voter confidence to try and get that discussion and dialogue of government. And the way it work goes, I chose four dimensions from local commodities here. And I tried that the whole an angel of a very liberal to very concerned with, to the election of the higher. The people that</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
We had set up a table for the previous Mage. They were actually rearranging their name tags on the particular example, because there were certain people that victimized sickness At least and they traveled around State, New Hampshire. And they held a number of hearings that were And each hearing was set up so that the first half of it was to hear from experts in the field. So, we had some sessions that included the chairs of the political parties. We had a session that dealt with pollsters coming in. We’ll talk about election tracks. We had academics payment to talk about how they were seeing in the political science sector.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Election officials. And then in the second half. We open lots of the park and what was great about that? Was that we had a whole range of political theories, representative by people, that wanted to show that and speak. And in a way it allowed them to vent. Although the discussion, mostly, it was very civil. But I got the sense that the people appreciated</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
And after saying that, I don’t think we do that enough. That’s a really important thing that government needs to take the time to bless again. So the committee travel around the state, and by the end, by the 12 trip, they were heartbling, insane van, stopping the restaurant to eat and become social event for them, which was really rewarding to see. And as they became friends, They could have discussions and disagree, like they weren’t disagreeable. Interact. And so they eventually wrote a report. That was filled with probably 24 25 recommendations and how do we could improve the electric process and get people on the board to, you know, to work together and trust the electrical processes.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
It was almost unanimous there was, there was just one individual who wouldn’t sign on to a group of people but did write a An alternate report which agreed pretty much about 90 percent, but what was able to work. And so I I consider that a huge success. We spent the next two years at my office, working with the legislature and things that I can build in my office without any positional authorization to start addressing the issues. Okay. Is so what were the to me? There were, there were a couple really Oh, I have for that is level one. Is that where we have issues with the election process or where there are parts of that process that are not mentally transparent for Motors and cellulars, can’t really see what’s going on or understanding and some examples of that are valid body devices. Where’s God, and Martha, Ballard, and put their pallet and the Machine and it goes in there. And</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Well, so they don’t know. So that’s a big issue. The other, the other issue is absentee bone is how it’s actually lead the protection of the top Target, but they go out there and somebody gets sometimes that And we trusted New Hampshire. That the iceberg are very close by now, there were some checks and balances on that process. Because the average voter doesn’t seem to across its owners. And then when they hear voters in New Hampshire in here, about things like file harvesting and drop boxes, famous and other parts of the country. They think that it is automatically happened in New Hampshire and those are areas that I put in the trash there in</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
So, The efforts that we have been engaging in is two main categories, one, Is. Make the process as transparently as possible. Because there should be no secrets that I have the offering crisis for us. The only thing I truly secret is how we’re going to become actually work with our employees. And then the other part of it is to educate the public the voters on how the processed workers most voters in a miniature. I’m sure elsewhere around the country are walk in the quiet place and get their ballot and Market put it in and</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
If they don’t know that there are built in checks and balances that are working with home. Places that, for example, the book reporting is a petrol point. The individualists will serve just developers. Of course that depends on the battle on the other one is part of the name. Most voters have no idea, but with their future is right there, but the political authorities, schedule, appoint a official Challengers. So they can have individuals that</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Much so that they can see and hear who is going through a voting in that particular election. And then we have taken the extra initiative. Doing a lot more than social media. Sort of putting off election facts on tracks by elections, just spraying. A lot of information, basic information about how elections run and operate so that the voters can understand it. We’re engaging, we are engaging students and the schools at all level all levels. But we have a really great minorities. Different contest that generated interest male entry schools, thousands of students submitted at We recently hired a sentence and motor education. I am here. Who’s going to reach out on starting departments that about election related, studies corporate, and the school systems. And that really long beyond that, where we are going to reach out to veterans groups, which we are pointing out to service groups like Lions Club, produce and Mars, senior senior citizenships,</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Not only to participate more in front of voting. And take it one step further. Actually, engage into plexus and publicly learning an election soon as a board because the more we can get people to actually participate in in an actual election. They walk away at him, the bank knowing that</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
And I think that’s the key. There’s no question in my mind that we have a long material of effective in the diverse viewpoints that we have the election process of Soviet degrade at this point, that it’s going to take some time to use, but we’d have to get back to a point where faithful here, uh, faith and trust religious process and most of you, those of you that are good that are hackers that make you up here because she is up there.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
These systems that are developed some companies like proprietary software and it’s part of the transparency issue, that’s a problem. And so to the extent that you can, hopefully, have vulnerabilities and violence for those machines and identify them, then we can take that information, prices are safe and accurate habit. I can’t remember, I could results in your work job. So I’m going to take a break from Child Car. I refuse to be more interactive.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Thank you so much.</p>
<p>[Speaker 4]
It’s very interesting to hear on the season for the Dutch electoral council. So it’s kind of similar to your office I think but please wallet. So I was wondering, you were talking about um like the people that wrote the report they said there was a lack of transparency and they referred to Balance County machines and you. Yeah, you you said you’re well for transparency. So how did you change the election process? What what are our dates to the counting? The development machines. How did you provide or transparency for Motors?</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
That’s a great question about you. I’m glad you’re asking number. One is New Hampshire is now the legislature that has passed all calling for Autumns for Ally County devices in library. And that’s really important time. It’s going to take us some time to properly, develop it because In from the order, right? You have to own optimate scan device to two newer visitor, scan analysis and that digital scan opportunity does kind of really open opportunities for the types of events that might be development in New Hampshire, we still will sometimes and counter values because some of the public places are actually quite small. And really can’t justify our past, just the car Shield or the other great thing is</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
I saw user’s open source software in recovery. So anybody that is the technical ability to entire to see how everybody is counted. Balance has an opportunity to do so those are initial steps but with spending on the way out,</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Thanks</p>
<p>[Speaker 5]
For your talk. We didn’t, um, talk so much about this, but cat touched on it in the introduction about the AI, uh, experience. That happened in New Hampshire and I wondered and I recently departed Justice issued a letter of an unstated and choice for somebody in in that situation. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that,</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Okay? So</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
A pre-framing experience been. It happened was to wake up on the morning before. New Hampshire. First in the nation, has such primary with the reporters for the media calling in along with voters, in the state of New Hampshire, talking about this call, there was received with President Biden’s voice That was. Tell me, borders. The presidential primary was not that important. Then the general election was again report that they should save their vote and vote into the background and along with Ms. Prego obvious form of motor suppression and I think most voters kind of scratched their heads when I heard the message.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
But the there was, there was a spoofing and phone number in that a call a caller, my name was showing the call was coming from a former state of New Hampshire Democratic, charity of the party. And so, she was getting a lot of policy. Why are you? Why are you sending me this call as it by its voice? The A’s office attorney general’s office, in New Hampshire. It came out very quickly with messaging that said, To call us informative separation. It was illegal and then people should ignore it. And then I was able to amplify that message because all of the national media were in New Hampshire, followed across the primary election. And to them, this was my base scores. And so we were able to have interviews and that lesson job. It was it was very widespread. So I can’t say that there were some voters that were fooled by that call.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
But it did not get back, the outcome of the elections so which was not very positive thing.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
The, the Attorney General’s office was able to utilize resources and vendors. To identifying where the marking from. Identify companies that are responsible for actually creating with artificially generated voice. Joe Biden. And they were able to First find individuals that was paid, 150 dollars to make the call and then they were able to find him a the app and the call was made from and were able to locate the source of mobile buyer. And they finally found the individual is responsible for the whole final. Who is now facing a couple of times ago. Six million dollars in.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Federal election, commissioner clients. So, the person is pretty much trouble.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
This is the thing about that whole issue. Now it is You that the cost office of foreign disinformation and misinformation. But if that is nothing available, candidates such as playing dirty tricks, in other candidates, since we’ve been happy elections and so in that regard, he took place. There’s nothing to do what was different. However, it was the rapid use and expensive technology that that created this life. Messaging. And you can picture it and they Similar phone message by using the actual image of my candidate or an election official. I had been saying something. Where the event or the message?</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that’s that’s something that that I think we have to really look at and figure out how you were going to address. And I think that’s something that’s going to evolve the world and New Hampshire, as a result of that New Hampshire that passing a lot that requires and certain instances that it must be disclaimer organization. And artificial intelligence was used to generate</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Good guys are going to follow uh, Delicious diapers. So that’s that’s the state of where that’s pretty much.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
That’s</p>
<p>[Speaker 6]
Wonderful idea about all the work going. I wonder if you’re all about the work that’s going</p>
<p>[Speaker 7]
On because you’re being able voters and safety of voters confidence and to enable them. But but I’m curious about the attorney’s, generals and others in some places that are not a lot of impact kids, or what your thoughts on that. Are you agree with my feelings on that?</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Um,</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
We have a very good relationship. The Secretary of State in New Hampshire is responsible for the manuscript which follows and attorney general relates to their expensively enforcing power. So, we become aware of initial evaluation is standing along with the matchments that we will.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
Inappropriate activities, stop the line. And then, there are two people responsible employing and prosecute. This chair is a</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
This is I think participline when they finished it, if I made the statement and everybody was qualified for whatever applications in this country released past that should have the opportunity to easily exercise for like the public. I think there would be pretty achieve the rest of the brain. Can you believe it? I think, if I made a similar statement it said and it was fair.</p>
<p>[Speaker 1]
And then those individuals will qualify. Will receive some some universal accomplishment but yeah, you know, only vehicle involved are grants that should be building in this country. Problem that we have. But I think this is someone that are the issues that we face today. Is that there’s a tension between those two.</p></article><hr/><div class="page-footer"></div></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div class="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[],&quot;focusOnHover&quot;:false,&quot;enableRadial&quot;:false}"></div><button class="global-graph-icon" aria-label="Global Graph"><svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xml:space="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
